Here are the intructions for obtaining the map data for mapping block names from the custom format used by GrabCraft to the one used by MC

1. Get the csv from https://github.com/gbl/GrabcraftLitematic/blob/master/blockmap.csv
2. Clean up the data by changing the settings to that of normal csvs (with commas instead of \t as a separator) (I personally just dropped it into Google Sheets and let Google Sheets reformat it for me)
3. Remove unnecessary parts of the data by running `clean_block_map.py`
4. Add whatever blocks you need to add (if you do end up improving the block mappings please provide a pull request to both my repository and that of gbl)
